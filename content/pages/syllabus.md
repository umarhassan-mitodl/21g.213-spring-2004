## Course Description

This class is designed to improve your academic language skills in written and spoken English. Through writing short essays and memos, you will learn how to organize your arguments and review points of English grammar that still challenge you. In addition, you will work on developing oral skills needed in a variety of academic contexts, i.e., group discussions, debates, and presentations.

## Attendance and Participation

Attendance is required at all classes. Roll will be taken at the beginning of class; you are expected to be on time. If you must be absent, be sure to check with another student to see what you missed so that you can make up the work. Excessive absences will result in a failing grade. In order for class discussions to be productive, it is imperative that every student come to class prepared to participate actively.
